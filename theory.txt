1. What is HTML and why is it important for web development?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create the structure of web pages.

It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, tables, and more.

Without HTML, browsers would have no instructions on how to display content.

It’s important because it provides the foundation of every website. CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) are built on top of HTML.


2. Difference between HTML elements and tags

Tags are the actual code snippets enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <p>, </p>, <img>).

Elements are the complete structure consisting of opening tag, content (if any), and closing tag.


3. New features introduced in HTML5

HTML5 introduced many improvements over older versions. Some key features:

New semantic elements: <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <nav>, etc. (help with structure & SEO)

Multimedia support: <audio> and <video> tags (no need for plugins like Flash)

Form enhancements: new input types like email, date, range, number

Canvas & SVG: for drawing graphics and animations

Local storage & session storage: store data in the browser without cookies

Geolocation API: get the user’s location

Responsive design support: better with <meta viewport>


4. Ensuring accessibility in HTML

To make web content usable by people with disabilities, follow web accessibility practices:

Use semantic HTML (e.g., use <button> instead of clickable <div>)

Provide alt text for images (<img src="..." alt="Description">)

Ensure good color contrast and readable fonts

Use labels for form fields (<label for="email">Email</label>)

Enable keyboard navigation (e.g., don’t trap focus)

Use ARIA roles when semantic HTML isn’t enough


5. What is the Document Object Model (DOM), and how does it relate to HTML?

The DOM is a tree-like representation of a web page that browsers create after reading your HTML.

Each HTML element becomes a node in the tree1
